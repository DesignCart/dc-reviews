🧩 DC Reviews — customer reviews module for OpenCart 4

DC Reviews is a lightweight and flexible module developed by Design Cart for OpenCart 4.
It lets store owners display customer feedback from any source — Google Business, Aleo, Facebook, or product pages — in an attractive, fully responsive carousel.
The goal is simple: build trust and credibility with real reviews while keeping the system fast, clean, and easy to manage.

🌟 Why this module was created

Most free OpenCart review extensions are either complex or limited — they often convert only reviews posted through a specific product system or require paid integrations to show external ratings.
DC Reviews was built to fix that.
It allows you to manually add and manage all your reviews in one place, old or new, without paying for “Pro” versions or external APIs.

⚙️ Key features

⭐ Star ratings – visually highlight customer satisfaction.

📸 Reviewer photo – adds authenticity and human touch.

🧾 Reviewer name – reinforces credibility and context.

📊 Structured data (schema.org AggregateRating) – boosts SEO and allows Google to display star snippets.

🎠 Owl Carousel integration – smooth, dynamic review rotation.

🎨 Full color & typography customization – adjust backgrounds, stars, borders, and fonts.

📱 Bootstrap 5 responsive layout – looks great on any OpenCart 4 theme.

🧩 No core overrides – safe installation and updates.

🚀 Lightweight code – designed for performance and stability.

🖼️ How it looks

Reviews appear in a sleek Owl Carousel slider that fits perfectly between sections such as “About Us” or “Before Footer.”
You can choose between light or dark layouts, match brand colors, and create elegant testimonial blocks that elevate your store’s look and feel.
